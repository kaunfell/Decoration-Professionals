**Decoration Professionals**

This project involved learning to create a website using Javascript and learning to use Git and Github.
The goals and experiments for this project:

    -Making a side navigation bar that appears when clicking the menu icon.
    -Ensuring that only one menu item (Services) becomes visible when clicked.
    -Enlarging images when hovered over and clicked.
    -Making an HTML form area.

There are a few known issues that require attention:

    -Media queries need to be fixed.
    -The positioning of the most left and most right project pictures could be more centered.
